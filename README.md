## [Orleans.Activities v1.x](https://github.com/lmagyar/Presentations/raw/master/Presentations/Orleans.Activities.pptx)
##### Workflow Foundation on Microsoft Orleans - Long lived transactions on cloud level

repo: https://github.com/OrleansContrib/Orleans.Activities

> :construction: *The presentation is about the planned v1.x version, the current v0.x version:* :construction:
> - Uses Orleans v1.5 (and not v2.0) :soon:
> - Doesn't support .NET Standard v2.0 only .NET Framework 4.6.1 (soon, with [Core WF](https://github.com/dmetzgar/corewf)) :soon:
> - Though, the current version fully implements the concepts in the presentation and is a functional POC code
